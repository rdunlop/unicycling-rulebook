heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter
- create a conf table, to configure the instance with the expected names/etc?
- add auto-enroll YES

- Update the _end_date properly
- permissions to restrict who can do what to what object
- Move proposal logic into the model

- Change to use 'thin' server (as per heroku documentation https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3)

- Add ability for Admin to adjust the admin status of another user.

- The New Proposal "Comittee" selection should ONLY be the committees that I am a member of.

- If I am not a member of any committees, put a message on the 'new proposal' page to say "e-mail the chairperson"
- When a new proposal is submitted, e-mail it to the adminemail cc the 'backup' address.

- Only allow proposal to be view by: admin, owner, (committee-member AND if the proposal IS NOT submitted.)

- From Proposal-view, should be allowed to 'edit' proposal in various ways (Approve, Table, un_table, change-votes,change back to pre-voting, change dates, change committee)


Instructions:
- Create a Single Committtee
- Q: Should I auto-assign new people to the committee, or require (like now) that the administrator assign them to the committee, and determine if they are a "voting" member.
- Q: Should we restrict the time that the committee is open for new registrants (right now, it has a hard-coded date which disables the sign-up form)
