Allow SuperAdmin:
Known issues:
- Fix that some discussions have no associated committee (but they _do_ have a proposal?...bad migration?)
- Word-counting of Revision text is broken (it always sayss 500 characters remain)

Friday To-Do:
-Brakeman
- Update FAQ to describe that "you do not get e-mails for votes when you have submitted your vote"
 - Only Voting members receive e-mail about voting?
 - Update "Table" to include a description?
- Create scopes for the "vote_submitted" mailer search lists (like: voting_members, voted_members, etc)

#####- Add ability for Admin to adjust the admin status of another user.

- Add option to "auto-enroll" people to a given group (include option about whether they are a voting member by default or not)

- Add freeform text box to application

- "Do not send me e-mails"
- "send me e-mail once a week"

- Can I change it so that the system sends e-mails based on the 'read-ability' of objects, instead of the relationship. (thus all super-admin would get ALL e-mails).

- Add interface to allow people to modify these settings for themselves easily.
- Update the e-mails with a footer which talks about how to modify these settings
 - Receive e-mails for comments/proposals/votes options


- Remove indication of who-voted-what based on Olaf.
- display "who voted" for admins
- Hide the voting results while voting is in progress.
- Add indication of percentage:
  - Add indicators to show whether the proposal will pass/fail based on the quorum rules.
- Display indicators which say that "Your name will not be displayed along with your vote."


- Clean up the redundant code in the tests....really nasty duplication
- Add unit tests for user:is_in_committee/etc methods


- Add Conf table which allows admin to specify the time-delay for many things
- Send an e-mail to the admin whenever a new application is receieved.

- Add Conf table which allows admin to specify that new applications are no longer accepted?

- REVOKE my gmail password, and create a new gmail account for using?


- Ask Olaf which statuses should "PUBLIC" be allowed to see proposals....Passed? Other?
- Ability for public to "read" proposals that have "passed".
 - Ability for public to "read" proposals and comments while they are in progress. But not comment. Configurable?


- Learn why self.number_of_votincg_members gives me private/public error

- Write up the usage for the system, and how it can be configured.
 - Please allow 30 seconds when you first load the page....it may take a few seconds before it comes up.

- list all committees in the "sign up" form, and allow people to enter their preferences when signing up. (perhaps as freeform text?)
- only display voting info to members
- create a conf table, to configure the instance with the expected names/etc?

- Update the _end_date properly
- permissions to restrict who can do what to what object
- Move proposal logic into the model

- Change to use 'thin' server (as per heroku documentation https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3)


- If I am not a member of any committees, put a message on the 'new proposal' page to say "e-mail the chairperson"

- Only allow proposal to be view by: admin, owner, (committee-member AND if the proposal IS NOT submitted.)

- From Proposal-view, should be allowed to 'edit' proposal in various ways (Approve, Table, un_table, change-votes,change back to pre-voting, change dates, change committee)

- Mock Time.now, and pass it around, to eliminate 'fuzzy-matching' when checking timestamps.

Instructions:
- Create a Single Committtee
- Q: Should I auto-assign new people to the committee, or require (like now) that the administrator assign them to the committee, and determine if they are a "voting" member.
- Q: Should we restrict the time that the committee is open for new registrants (right now, it has a hard-coded date which disables the sign-up form)
